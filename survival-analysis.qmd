# Survival Analysis and Censored Data

In this models the outcome variable is the **time until an event occurs** or any other numeric variable have been **censored** by any limitation during data collection.

- **Survival time** $T$: Represents the time at which the event of interest occurs. For instance, the time at which the *patient dies* or the *customer cancels his or her subscription*.
- **Censoring, failure or event time** $C$: Represents the time at which censoring occurs. For example, the time at which the patient *drops out of the study* or the *study ends*.

As result our target variable is the result of:

$$
Y = \min(T, C)
$$

To know how to interpret the results we will need an indicator:

$$
\delta = 
 \begin{cases}
   1 & \quad \text{if } T \leq C \\
   0 & \quad \text{if } T > C
 \end{cases}
$$
