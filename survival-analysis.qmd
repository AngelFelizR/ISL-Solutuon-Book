# Survival Analysis and Censored Data

In this models the outcome variable is the **time until an event occurs** or any other numeric variable have been **censored** by any limitation during data collection.

- **Survival time** $T$: Represents the time at which the event of interest occurs. For instance, the time at which the *patient dies* or the *customer cancels his or her subscription*.
- **Censoring, failure or event time** $C$: Represents the time at which censoring occurs. For example, the time at which the patient *drops out of the study* or the *study ends*.

As result our target variable is the result of:

$$
Y = \min(T, C)
$$

To know how to interpret the results we will need an indicator:

$$
\delta = 
 \begin{cases}
   1 & \quad \text{if } T \leq C \\
   0 & \quad \text{if } T > C
 \end{cases}
$$

As result when $\delta = 1$ we observe the true survival time, and when $\delta = 0$ if we observe the censoring time.In the next example, we just could observe the event for patients 1 and 3 before ending the study.

## Assumptions

In order to analyze survival data, we need to determine whether the following assumptions are reasonable:

- The **event time** $T$ **is independent of the censoring time** $C$. For example, *patients drop out of the cancer study early because they are very sick*, that would **overestimate** the true average survival time. We can check this assumption by exploring the ***reasons related to dropouts***.

- The **predictors are independent of the censoring event** $\delta = 0$. For example, if in our study *very sick males are more likely to drop out of the study than very sick females*, that would drive the **wrong conclusion** that males survive longer than females.

## Censoring types

1. **Right censoring**: It occurs when $T \geq Y$, i.e. the true event time $T$ is at least as large as the observed time $Y$.
2. **Left censoring**: It occurs when $T \leq Y$, i.e. the true event time $T$ is less than or equal to the observed time $Y$.
3. **Interval censoring**: It refers to the setting in which we do not know the exact event time, but we know that it falls in some interval.

*Right censoring will be the main focus of this chapter.*
